# Flight Booker
### About

The purpose of this [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms) is to
create a website with similar functionality to a site that lets you book flights, minus actually booking the flight.
The goal is to have a chance to work with more advanced forms while I develop the site.

#### Requirements:
* Ruby 2.6.3
